    "\n",
    "### Observation\n",
    "The approach to modeling a reach curve significantly depends on the media type.\n",
    "\n",
    "For TV, a single ad impression can reach multiple viewers at once, but you can't distinguish between them. It also makes it impossible to prevent repeat views to the same individual.\n",
    "\n",
    "On digital platforms, you pay for every impression. Here, the situation is more complex. While you can sometimes track if a user has seen an ad before (if they aren't anonymous), a single person might have multiple accounts. The platform sees these as different users, which inflates your reach numbers and makes it difficult to accurately cap frequency for that individual.\n",
    "\n",
    "For the notebook, let's simplify this by treating each impression as a request from a user. Assume there's no tracking history, meaning we can't tell if a user has already seen an ad. This assumption makes it possible for users to see the same ad multiple times."
