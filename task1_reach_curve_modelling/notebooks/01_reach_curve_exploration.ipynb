    "\n",

    "\n",
    "On the other hand, about 15% of the population spends the most time on this medium compared to all other groups. This group will likely contain the highest number of individuals who will see an advertisement multiple times. Because of it - the reach curve will flatten – despite an increase in the number of impressions."

    "3. The minimum value is 0 (it would be interesting to estimate this worst-case scenario somehow—i.e., what would be the chances that absolutely no one gets any impression even once).\n",
    "4. The reach curve is a non-decreasing curve because an impression, once received, cannot be unreceived (or taken back).\n",

    "### Simplistic scenario\n",
    "Data observations provide some insight into the approximate shape of the reach curve.\n",
    "\n",
    "Really simplistic scenario:\n",
    "There's an initial rapid growth to approximately 14 percent, followed by a similarly swift increase to 31 percent, and then to 52 percent, and so on. This offers a clearer intuition regarding the mathematical model, indicating that ```timespend``` will correspond with the reach curve's rate of growth (its derivative), whereas ```perc_of_total_cum``` will correspond to distinct points where the reach curve exhibits unique changes.\n",
    "\n",
    "I'd like to start with a simple model, even with some simplifications and additional assumptions (which I'll mention shortly), to have a reference point. After that, I'll try to incorporate more subtle elements into the model, so the assumptions better reflect the actual data I've received.\n",
    "\n",
    "Of course, in this simplified scenario, I'm assuming that people with the highest timespend (those with 0.84) will get impression first, followed by those in the next group (0.67), and so on.\n",
    "\n",
    "### A little more serious approach\n",
    "I've been thinking about this more, and I could simplify the situation for a moment by observing a group that spends a similar amount of time watching the medium. I would then consider a random variable X_i​, which assigns to each user i the number of viewed impressions. So, for the entire group, I would be dealing with a vector of random variables, for which several precise questions could be posed. Each of the individual components of this vector could follow a Bernoulli distribution with a fixed probability of success p, which would depend on the frequency of viewing that particular medium."
